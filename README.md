# Villas_PDP
A web site for villas for PDP

a site from the online course an address for the online course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-flexbox-grid-sass-animations-developer-course/ 
Please note the author of the course uses some horrible practices like selection by ID in CSS, using `let` instead of `const` a way to long html and css files etc. 
I've tried to fix it where possible, or just leave a comment that some not reasonable selection was done due studying purposes.

I've also ommited minification of the .css files by intention in order to make the review via borwsers a bit simplier.

HOW TO USE: just clone or download, run `index.html`
